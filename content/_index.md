I'm a B.Tech. student at IIT Roorkee studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, exploring the intersection of generative AI, diffusion models, and multimodal language models. 

I also have a notable interest in robotics and reinforcement learning.

## Research
* Detection Limits and Statistical Separability of Tree Ring Watermarks in Rectified Flow Models ([ICLR Workshop, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03850))

## Selected Projects
* Faulty Vibration Signal Data Multiplication using Diffusion (with Bosch).
* Centralized Dynamic Intelligence for Robot Swarm Using Multimodal RAG.
* AI Photo Editor using MobileSAM and LaMa Inpainting ([Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aakashks/adv-photo-editing))


## Achievements
* 4th position among 23 IITs in BharatForge's Problem Statement (InterIIT Tech Meet 2024)
* Ranked 16th out of 10k+ teams in Amazon ML Challenge 2024
* Silver medal in Kaggle AI Mathematics Olympiad 2024
